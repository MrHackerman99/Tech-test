### React Tech Test

---

Inside this directory you'll find a JSON payload which is a typical API response you can expect to receive when working on one of Pentest People's web applications. The JSON data includes a list of vulnerabilities and each vulnerability's associated information.

Your goal is to consume the data provided, using a package like Axios or the Fetch API (whichever approach you prefer), and create a small React application that displays a list of vulnerabilities and allows you to view each vulnerability in a separate view when selected. Users should be able to return back to the main list of vulnerabilities after viewing an individual vulnerability.

The UI should be fit for purpose but don't focus too much on making it pixel perfect. We're looking more at how you structure your application, how you organise your code, how you handle navigating between routes and the approach you take to consuming and displaying data.




Lewis's Notes:

With the time that i had and having to work around my day job i ended up not getting everything i wanted to do done. Personally i wouldn't call this production ready i know i could have done better if i didn't have to balance my current job and had more time, however i hope it suffices as a demo of what i can produce.

I wasn't able to get the unit testing set up as i have never set one up before just used an existing set up however i did make some unit tests that if where working should pass just to show that i can.

I wasn't able to get any typescript in as i had to focus on other areas but i have put in proptyping on my button and header component to show that i atleast understand static typing 

Finally the reason the tech-test is called v2 is beacuse i had a v1 but i changed the dependencies 

(Side note as i'm sure you already know this but to start my app just cd to my-app, npm i, npm start)
